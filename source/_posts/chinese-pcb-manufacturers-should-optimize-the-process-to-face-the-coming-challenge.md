### The Future of Chinese PCB Industry

Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is the electrical connection of electronic components. It is used in all but the simplest electronic products and some electrical products. The gross global production value of PCB industry accounts for more than one-quarter of the total output value of the electronic components industry, up to 60 billion US dollars. Due to the huge demand of China domestic market, along with the low labor costs and perfect industrial matching, global PCB production center has been gradually transferred to China since 2000. And in 2006, China has surpassed Japan and become the world's largest PCB producer.

On the report of the National Bureau of Statistics, the latest China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) of China as the world’s second-largest economy has hovered between 50.1 and 51.7 index points during 2014, which indicates a positive situation in manufacturing growth. While the PCB industry has a long history in China and has gone through a number of cycles. From the rapid start in 1980-1990 (CAGR = 15.9%), to the sustained growth in 1991-2000 (CAGR = 7.1%), and to the great fluctuations in 2001-2010 (CAGR = 2.1%). Until now it starts a stable growth period in 2011. It is expected that the global PCB will maintain a compound growth rate of 3.2% in 2017-2022. In general, the Chinese manufacturing industry continued to expand at a slower speed and development of the electronic components industry is still on the rise.

According to statistics, the number of professional SMT & PCB factories in China has reached 5000. The total purchases of PCB products, PCBA and SMT services, and the final electronic products in China by overseas purchasers have accounted for more than one-half of their total purchases. However, China still has a long way to go to become a strong PCB power. Previously, industry experts have warned that PCB enterprises should pay attention to the fact that China's PCB industry will not continue to grow at a high speed in the future. As the result, the product structure of PCB will change dramatically in the future. Not only the quantity will increase, but also the difficulty will rise.

Therefore, to have better development, PCB companies should keep the pace with the trend of times. In terms of the specific classification, it is expected that by 2021, the proportion of PCB with high technology content, such as multi-layer board, flexible plate, and HDI will reach 60.58%, and become the mainstream of the market. In this case, PCB manufacturers should, on the one hand, follow the latest industry news, on the other hand, optimize the process and continuously improve their automation and intelligence capabilities. In addition, PCB company should also pay attention to the future trends of other electronic industries. The continuous growth of the market will inevitably increase the needs for PCB board and related services.
