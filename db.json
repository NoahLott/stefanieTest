As the techniques have been around for a long time, many of today's developers are not aware of them.

This need of programmer adaptation is especially conspicuous in neuro-scientific high-effectiveness processing (HPC), where developers typically optimize for the prospective node architecture to squeeze out every previous ounce of available effectiveness.

Because the application could not really always be vectorized and parallelized instantly by the compiler, the application form developer had to do something.\n\nThat something ranged from writing important kernels in particular programming models like CUDA for the Nvidia GPUs, to using compiler directives to greatly help the compiler translate the input user-level code into low-level vectorized code for the processors. In that case there was the issue of using those cores on the node / making a large number of threads for the GPU.

As the techniques have been around for a long time, many of today’s developers are not aware of them. Let us explain.</p>\n<p>The supercomputer is a shifting target for application programmers since its inception in the form of Seymour Cray’s CDC 6600 in the first 1970s, forcing developers to adjust to new approaches together with the ever-changing hardware and software systems. This need of programmer adaptation is especially conspicuous in neuro-scientific high-effectiveness processing (HPC), where developers typically optimize for the prospective node architecture to squeeze out every previous ounce of available effectiveness. This continued through the CDC7600 and the vector-rich systems: Cray 1, Cray XMP, YMP, and C90.</p>\n<p>Then, the “Attack of the killer micros” in the 1990s threw everything right into a tizzy. With raising node counts, request developers possessed to consider PVM, and MPI, within their quest to parallelize their applications across the multitude of nodes comprising commodity off-the-shelf (COTS) chips without the vector instructions. As can be seen in Figure 1, the COTS chips acquired more rapidly as their clock routine time decreased between 1995 and 2010. Software developers no more had to be worried about the node architecture.</p>","more":"<p>With the advent of AVX256, AVX512, SVE, and GPUs in the last five years, vectors have begun to come back. More recently, many-core devices like Intel’s Knight’s Landing (KNL) in addition to fastened accelerators such as for example Nvidia’s type of GPUs required a re-examination of the application form to progress performance from the brand new, more-powerful nodes. Because the application could not really always be vectorized and parallelized instantly by the compiler, the application form developer had to do something.</p>\n<p>That something ranged from writing important kernels in particular programming models like CUDA for the Nvidia GPUs, to using compiler directives to greatly help the compiler translate the input user-level code into low-level vectorized code for the processors. In that case there was the issue of using those cores on the node / making a large number of threads for the GPU. Because jogging MPI across all the cores on and off the nodes proved helpful pretty much, the developers for the original multi core systems didn’t should get into parallelizing with shared recollection threads. Even so, threading on Nvidia accelerators was definitely required. OpenACC and OpenMP 4.5 were developed for a performance-portable solution for threading and vectorization for the GPU.</p>\n<p>Another revelation in different architectures is that memory space hierarchies have become more complex, especially if an application has a large memory space footprint. Knight’s Landing, together with nodes with fastened GPU accelerators, possess two levels of recollection which introduces new issues that must be tackled by programmers. Shape 2 shows the dissimilarities between the recollection hierarchies of KNL and the hosted GPU. If an application fits in to the high-speed memory, then it’ll enjoy excellent memory performance. Nevertheless, if the application form requires more memory, the info set must be managed to flow between the two within an efficient and timely approach.</p>\n<p>The last four to five years have already been a culture shock to those creators who insisted on productivity over performance. They are actually confronted with the serious task of properly utilizing these new strong nodes. If indeed they continue with all-MPI codes and do not perform the required conversion to multi-level parallel code (through vectorization and threading), their performance will be a function of merely the amount of cores on the node and the clock cycle. While the amount of cores on the node is certainly going up gradually, the clock rate of those cores is going down, leading to poor returns on latest hardware investments without software optimization.</p>\n<p>Our book Development for Hybrid Multi / Manycore MPP Devices discusses the architecture of the brand new nodes and programming techniques application developers may utilize to glean more performance. It’ll be extremely useful for all those developers who are now confronted with the significant challenge of getting increased effectiveness from the vector capacity for the node together with improved scaling over the increased amount of cores or threading for the GPU. The reserve also looks at the memory space hierarchy of the KNL and discusses many approaches for managing the data. Finally, the reserve looks to the near future, which is extra of the same in lots of ways: extra cores with wider vectors and also more technical memory hierarchies.</p>\n<p>If you’ll be at SC17 in Denver, be a part of us at Cray booth #625 for a good meet-the-author session at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, November 14.

The gross global production value of PCB industry accounts for more than one-quarter of the total output value of the electronic components industry, up to 60 billion US dollars. Due to the huge demand of China domestic market, along with the low labor costs and perfect industrial matching, global PCB production center has been gradually transferred to China since 2000. And in 2006, China has surpassed Japan and become the world's largest PCB producer.\n\n![](/images/9.jpg)\n\nOn the report of the National Bureau of Statistics, the latest China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) of China as the world’s second-largest economy has hovered between 50.1 and 51.7 index points during 2014, which indicates a positive situation in manufacturing growth. While the PCB industry has a long history in China and has gone through a number of cycles. From the rapid start in 1980-1990 (CAGR = 15.9%), to the sustained growth in 1991-2000 (CAGR = 7.1%), and to the great fluctuations in 2001-2010 (CAGR = 2.1%). Until now it starts a stable growth period in 2011. It is expected that the global PCB will maintain a compound growth rate of 3.2% in 2017-2022. In general, the Chinese manufacturing industry continued to expand at a slower speed and development of the electronic components industry is still on the rise.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nAccording to statistics, the number of professional SMT & PCB factories in China has reached 5000. The total purchases of PCB products, PCBA and SMT services, and the final electronic products in China by overseas purchasers have accounted for more than one-half of their total purchases. However, China still has a long way to go to become a strong PCB power.

It's generally cooled by drinking water running through small copper pipes encircling the node cards. Each cards retains 32 chips, with each chip having 16 cores.\n\nThe entire cluster is Linux-based. Compute Node Linux is run on almost 98,000 nodes, and Red Hat Business Linux runs on 768 I/O nodes which hook up to the file program, Cupps said.\n\nTo start out, the cluster is about a comparatively open network, allowing various scientists to use it. But after IBM's debugging method is over around February 2013, the cluster will be transferred to a categorized network that isn't available to academics or outside corporations. At that point, it'll be devoted almost specifically to simulations targeted at extending the lifespan of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe sort of science we must carry out is lifetime extension programs for nuclear weapons, Cupps said. That will require suites of codes jogging. What we're in a position to do upon this machine is to perform many calculations simultaneously on the device. You can turn various knobs in a brief time frame.\n\nBlue Gene/Q runs on the PowerPC architecture that includes components support for transactional memory space, allowing more comprehensive real-world assessment of technology.\n\nIn November 2011's Top 500 list, three of the top five clusters employed NVIDIA GPUs (graphics processing units) in combo with CPUs to accomplish very high speeds. This time around, just one of the very best five integrates GPUs, although the entire number in the most notable 500 integrating GPUs or identical accelerators rose from 39 to 58.\n\nThe use of GPUs in supercomputing tends to be experimental up to now, said Dave Turek, IBM vice president of high performance computing. The aim of this is to accomplish real technology, he said. GPUs are a bit more difficult to method for, he said.\n\nWhile the majority of Top 500 computers use Ethernet or Infiniband as their primary interconnects, Sequoia uses IBM's proprietary 5D Torus. It's an optical network that delivers 40 Gbps throughput to IBM's Blue Gene/Q clusters. I/O nodes are linked to the file program via Infiniband and the administration network uses Ethernet, Cupps stated.\n\nIBM leads the most notable 500 list with 213 systems, before HP's 138. Practically 80 percent-372 of the 500 systems-use Intel processors, accompanied by 63 employing AMD Operton and 58 using IBM Power.\n\nThree DOE systems happen to be in the very best 10. The others hail from Japan, Germany, China, Italy, and France. All 10 have effectiveness of at least at least 1.27 petaflops.\n\nPetascale computers have become relatively commonplace because the IBM Roadrunner program in Los Alamos National Laboratory was first the first to hit a petaflop in 2008. Actually, each of the top 20 devices on the brand new list hit at least a petaflop. Exascale, which would be 1,000 times faster, is the next big breakthrough for the IBMs, HPs, and Crays of the universe to aspire to.\n\nBut a big progress in price-performance is necessary. Today's technology could level up a lot higher-it merely wouldn't be practical. Supercomputers are naturally pricey (a lot more expensive than the latest MacBook Pro). The K Computer in Japan, for instance, cost a lot more than $1 billion to build and $10 million to operate each year. Livermore informed us it spent approximately $250 million on Sequoia.\n\nWe're able to get another order of magnitude with this technology if somebody would compose a check, Turek stated. But no one would want to write that check.�\n\n### How to use a good million-core supercomputer-without it blowing up in that person\n_Throwing more cores by science: risky for high reward._\n\nAt the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, a supercomputer named \"Sequoia\" puts almost every other computer on earth to shame. With 1.6 million processor cores (16 per CPU) across 96 racks, Sequoia can perform 16 thousand trillion calculations per second, or 16.32 petaflops.\n\nWho would demand such horsepower? The IBM Blue Gene/Q-based program was designed for the Section of Strength for simulations designed to lengthen the lifespan of nuclear weapons. But also for a limited time, the device is being distributed around outside researchers to execute a variety of tests, a couple of hours at a time.\n\nOne of the first to have good thing about this opportunity was Stanford University's Center for Turbulence Research-and it wasn't hesitant about seeing what this equipment is really capable of. For three hours on Tuesday of last week, researchers from the center remotely logged in to Sequoia to perform a computational liquid dynamics (CFD) simulation on a million cores at once-1,048,576 cores, to be exact.\n\nIt's part of a good project to test noise made by supersonic jet engines and support design engines that happen to be a bit quieter. The work is sponsored partly by the united states Navy, which is concerned about \"hearing damage that sailors on aircraft carrier decks come across as a result of jet noise,\" Study Associate Joseph Nichols of the guts for Turbulence Exploration told Ars.\n\nUsing huge supercomputers to solve complex scientific problems is usually in no way unique nowadays. Larger amounts of cores don't necessarily translate to the most effective speed, either, as a result of dissimilarities between processors and the styles of supercomputers. The million-core run is normally intriguing, but it additionally poses extreme issues in trying to work with all those cores simultaneously without things going incorrect.\n\nBelieve it or not, three several hours with a million cores wasn't enough to generate a real dent in the plane noise project. Despite planning work aimed at reducing out bottlenecks, it was just enough time to make certain the code ran properly also to get yourself a sense of the possibilities that million-core PCs can offer.\n\n\"This is really showing what we are able to do later on,\" Nichols said. \"The simulations take some time to boot up and go through initialization. We performed tune the I/O for the Blue Gene architecture, but it is nonetheless slower than the blindingly quickly computation and interaction speeds. Depending on how much info gets written, the I/O can truly add an extra chunk of period to the overhead.\"\n\nThe problems are all over the area, including \"How can you write into one file from a million processors that are trying to step on one another?\" Nichols said. \"That was an interesting thing. It kind of depended on the interconnect, too. Only a number of the processors happen to be linked to the disk, and that means you need to rearrange data to achieve the right performance.\"\n\n## Extra cores, or better cores?\n\nSequoia was named the world's quickest supercomputer in June 2012. Sequoia soon after fell to second place behind a 17.59-petaflop system at the Oak Ridge Countrywide Laboratory, but it is still the only system at the top 500 supercomputers list with a million or even more cores.\n\nOf course, choosing \"more cores\" isn't necessarily the easiest method to tackle a supercomputing problem. That Oak Ridge pc, named Titan, hit 17.59 petaflops using \"only\" 560,640 cores. The Titan program was developed by the supercomputer producer Cray, and it uses Nvidia design processing units furthermore to classic CPUs to get dramatic increases in quickness.\n\nThere are pros and cons to different approaches. Dave Turek, IBM vice president of powerful computing, told Ars this past year that GPUs happen to be more difficult to program for, and the GPU-significantly less Sequoia is for \"real science.\" Titan, it should be noted, does plenty of real technology, tackling problems linked to climate transformation, astrophysics, and more. With both CPUs and GPUs in something, Titan's CPUs guide the simulations but hand off do the job to the GPUs, which can handle a lot more calculations at once despite using only slightly more electricity.\n\nThrowing more cores at a problem doesn't invariably result in performance gains. Code needs to be carefully well prepared to take into account the bottlenecks that come up when information is transmitted from one core to another (unless the request is so parallel that each core could work on split calculations without ever talking to each other).\n\nPreviously, Nichols' biggest calculation was performed for approximately 100 hours on 131,072 cores on a Blue Gene/P system. The same calculation could possibly be done on a million Sequoia cores in about 8 to 12 time, he said.\n\nBesides accelerating lengthy calculations, even more cores and faster supercomputers will let scientists tackle a lot more complicated problems.\n\n\"Having more cores, either you reduce the time to choice or you solve more technical problems, problems involving circulation that involve, say, chemical substance reactions, combustion,\" stated Parviz Moin, director of the guts for Turbulence Research. \"These are grand challenge problems that involve many, many more equations and lots of work that will be distributed among the processors.\"\n\n## Getting code geared up for the million-core run\nNichols and team use the Navier-Stokes equations and codenamed CharLES for the plane noise simulations (LES means large eddy simulation). They're employing the same code for different projects to research scram jets (supersonic combustion ramjets), which could travel at 10 situations the speed of audio.\n\nWe've written before about large supercomputing runs-for example, one using 50,000 cores on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. That one was \"embarrassingly parallel,\" where the calculations are all independent of each other. Which means the swiftness of the interconnect, the connections between each processing key, didn't really matter.\n\nThe million-core run was not only substantially bigger, it was more complicated. \"It is parallel but there is connection [between processors] included,\" Moin explained. \"Each core is not independent.\"\n\nAs we wrote in August 2011, Blue Gene/Q uses \"transactional memory space\" to solve many of the issues that help to make highly scalable parallel development so hard. But prep function by humans is still required.\n\nNichols caused the Lawrence Livermore individuals to optimize the code for Sequoia, avoiding slowdowns found in I/O efficiency and minimizing the communication needed in each step.\n\nSequoia uses IBM's proprietary 5-dimensional Torus interconnect. Nichols explains:\n\n\"Each compute node is linked to 10 of its nearest neighbours. There will be five measurements and it goes forwards and backward along each dimension. That's 5x2 and you get 10 connections with these optical links.\"\n\n\"You can communicate with processors that are even more away, but it includes a bigger latency. Latency for the nearest neighbour is normally 80 nanoseconds, which is very amazing. The calculation uses the interconnect so that communication overhead was very little actually at a million processors.\"\n\nPerformance scaled almost in a one-to-1 ratio with the increase in cores, with 83 percent efficiency. Nichols clarifies that since heading from 131,000 cores to at least one 1 million multiplies the amount of cores by 8, one would want a speed-up of 8 as well.\n\nThe true speed-up was 6.6, which is \"83 percent of the perfect speed-up we would like to see. It signifies that as we're adding considerably more cores the code gets faster and faster, also at the million level. This is amazing for a CFD simulation, because in CFD simulations each one of these sub-domains features to talk to its neighbours at each time step to talk about wave information.\"\n\nModelling plane engines is sophisticated, as Stanford notes in a description of the project: \"These complex simulations let researchers to peer inside and measure processes happening within the tough exhaust environment that's otherwise inaccessible to experimental devices.\"\n\nThe simulations allow Stanford to test how adjustments to the engine nozzle and chevrons impact noise. With supercomputers these simulations can be carried out without building physical designs or tests in wind tunnels.\n\n\"That's a really complicated difficulty because you possess shock waves found in engines which are incredibly thin scales when compared to amount of the combustion,\" Nichols said. \"And then you have combustion as well as turbulence in everything. The theory is that people can predict the behaviour. If given enough resolution we can predict what will happen with various kinds of designs.\"\n\nThe analysis of scram jets and the conditions under which they might fail involves similar complexity. \"NASA is very much enthusiastic about such vehicles for access to space,\" Moin stated. \"These will be air-breathing vehicles instead of rockets. They take their personal oxygen to orbit; they're heavier due to that. They have to carry liquid oxygen.\"\n\nFor now, the researchers must continue this work with paltry sub-million-main supercomputers. But most likely it won't be a long time before supercomputers as powerful as Sequoia will be the standard for such research.\n\nAs a high school student in 1994, Nichols attended a summer season course at Lawrence Livermore and done the Cray Y-MP. At that time, it was among the faster machines on earth.\n\n\"Now Sequoia is 10 million times stronger than that equipment,\" Nichols said. \"This is presenting us a glimpse into the future, that it is really possible to run on a million cores.\"","source":"_posts/16-petaflops-and-more-core-without-it-blowing-up.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 16 Petaflops and More Core Without It Blowing Up \ndate: 2010-8-13 13:20:00\ncategory: programming\n---\n\n![](/images/4.jpg)\n\n## With 16 petaflops and 1.6M cores, DOE supercomputer is world's fastest\n\nEvery six months, Earth's most important supercomputers have a huge race to see that may lay claim to getting the world's most effective high-performance computing cluster.\n\nIn the most recent Top 500 Supercomputer Sites list unveiled Monday morning hours, a newly assembled cluster constructed with IBM hardware at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) takes the most notable prize.

Livermore informed us it spent approximately $250 million on Sequoia.\n\nWe're able to get another order of magnitude with this technology if somebody would compose a check, Turek stated. But no one would want to write that check.�\n\n### How to use a good million-core supercomputer-without it blowing up in that person\n_Throwing more cores by science: risky for high reward._\n\nAt the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, a supercomputer named \"Sequoia\" puts almost every other computer on earth to shame. With 1.6 million processor cores (16 per CPU) across 96 racks, Sequoia can perform 16 thousand trillion calculations per second, or 16.32 petaflops.\n\nWho would demand such horsepower? The IBM Blue Gene/Q-based program was designed for the Section of Strength for simulations designed to lengthen the lifespan of nuclear weapons. But also for a limited time, the device is being distributed around outside researchers to execute a variety of tests, a couple of hours at a time.\n\nOne of the first to have good thing about this opportunity was Stanford University's Center for Turbulence Research-and it wasn't hesitant about seeing what this equipment is really capable of. For three hours on Tuesday of last week, researchers from the center remotely logged in to Sequoia to perform a computational liquid dynamics (CFD) simulation on a million cores at once-1,048,576 cores, to be exact.\n\nIt's part of a good project to test noise made by supersonic jet engines and support design engines that happen to be a bit quieter. The work is sponsored partly by the united states Navy, which is concerned about \"hearing damage that sailors on aircraft carrier decks come across as a result of jet noise,\" Study Associate Joseph Nichols of the guts for Turbulence Exploration told Ars.\n\nUsing huge supercomputers to solve complex scientific problems is usually in no way unique nowadays. Larger amounts of cores don't necessarily translate to the most effective speed, either, as a result of dissimilarities between processors and the styles of supercomputers. The million-core run is normally intriguing, but it additionally poses extreme issues in trying to work with all those cores simultaneously without things going incorrect.\n\nBelieve it or not, three several hours with a million cores wasn't enough to generate a real dent in the plane noise project. Despite planning work aimed at reducing out bottlenecks, it was just enough time to make certain the code ran properly also to get yourself a sense of the possibilities that million-core PCs can offer.\n\n\"This is really showing what we are able to do later on,\" Nichols said. \"The simulations take some time to boot up and go through initialization. We performed tune the I/O for the Blue Gene architecture, but it is nonetheless slower than the blindingly quickly computation and interaction speeds. Depending on how much info gets written, the I/O can truly add an extra chunk of period to the overhead.\"\n\nThe problems are all over the area, including \"How can you write into one file from a million processors that are trying to step on one another?\" Nichols said. \"That was an interesting thing. It kind of depended on the interconnect, too. Only a number of the processors happen to be linked to the disk, and that means you need to rearrange data to achieve the right performance.\"\n\n## Extra cores, or better cores?\n\nSequoia was named the world's quickest supercomputer in June 2012. Sequoia soon after fell to second place behind a 17.59-petaflop system at the Oak Ridge Countrywide Laboratory, but it is still the only system at the top 500 supercomputers list with a million or even more cores.\n\nOf course, choosing \"more cores\" isn't necessarily the easiest method to tackle a supercomputing problem. That Oak Ridge pc, named Titan, hit 17.59 petaflops using \"only\" 560,640 cores. The Titan program was developed by the supercomputer producer Cray, and it uses Nvidia design processing units furthermore to classic CPUs to get dramatic increases in quickness.\n\nThere are pros and cons to different approaches. Dave Turek, IBM vice president of powerful computing, told Ars this past year that GPUs happen to be more difficult to program for, and the GPU-significantly less Sequoia is for \"real science.\" Titan, it should be noted, does plenty of real technology, tackling problems linked to climate transformation, astrophysics, and more. With both CPUs and GPUs in something, Titan's CPUs guide the simulations but hand off do the job to the GPUs, which can handle a lot more calculations at once despite using only slightly more electricity.\n\nThrowing more cores at a problem doesn't invariably result in performance gains. Code needs to be carefully well prepared to take into account the bottlenecks that come up when information is transmitted from one core to another (unless the request is so parallel that each core could work on split calculations without ever talking to each other).\n\nPreviously, Nichols' biggest calculation was performed for approximately 100 hours on 131,072 cores on a Blue Gene/P system. The same calculation could possibly be done on a million Sequoia cores in about 8 to 12 time, he said.\n\nBesides accelerating lengthy calculations, even more cores and faster supercomputers will let scientists tackle a lot more complicated problems.\n\n\"Having more cores, either you reduce the time to choice or you solve more technical problems, problems involving circulation that involve, say, chemical substance reactions, combustion,\" stated Parviz Moin, director of the guts for Turbulence Research. \"These are grand challenge problems that involve many, many more equations and lots of work that will be distributed among the processors.\"\n\n## Getting code geared up for the million-core run\nNichols and team use the Navier-Stokes equations and codenamed CharLES for the plane noise simulations (LES means large eddy simulation). They're employing the same code for different projects to research scram jets (supersonic combustion ramjets), which could travel at 10 situations the speed of audio.\n\nWe've written before about large supercomputing runs-for example, one using 50,000 cores on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. That one was \"embarrassingly parallel,\" where the calculations are all independent of each other. Which means the swiftness of the interconnect, the connections between each processing key, didn't really matter.\n\nThe million-core run was not only substantially bigger, it was more complicated. \"It is parallel but there is connection [between processors] included,\" Moin explained. \"Each core is not independent.\"\n\nAs we wrote in August 2011, Blue Gene/Q uses \"transactional memory space\" to solve many of the issues that help to make highly scalable parallel development so hard. But prep function by humans is still required.\n\nNichols caused the Lawrence Livermore individuals to optimize the code for Sequoia, avoiding slowdowns found in I/O efficiency and minimizing the communication needed in each step.\n\nSequoia uses IBM's proprietary 5-dimensional Torus interconnect. Nichols explains:\n\n\"Each compute node is linked to 10 of its nearest neighbours. There will be five measurements and it goes forwards and backward along each dimension. That's 5x2 and you get 10 connections with these optical links.\"\n\n\"You can communicate with processors that are even more away, but it includes a bigger latency. Latency for the nearest neighbour is normally 80 nanoseconds, which is very amazing. The calculation uses the interconnect so that communication overhead was very little actually at a million processors.\"\n\nPerformance scaled almost in a one-to-1 ratio with the increase in cores, with 83 percent efficiency. Nichols clarifies that since heading from 131,000 cores to at least one 1 million multiplies the amount of cores by 8, one would want a speed-up of 8 as well.\n\nThe true speed-up was 6.6, which is \"83 percent of the perfect speed-up we would like to see. It signifies that as we're adding considerably more cores the code gets faster and faster, also at the million level. This is amazing for a CFD simulation, because in CFD simulations each one of these sub-domains features to talk to its neighbours at each time step to talk about wave information.\"\n\nModelling plane engines is sophisticated, as Stanford notes in a description of the project: \"These complex simulations let researchers to peer inside and measure processes happening within the tough exhaust environment that's otherwise inaccessible to experimental devices.\"\n\nThe simulations allow Stanford to test how adjustments to the engine nozzle and chevrons impact noise. With supercomputers these simulations can be carried out without building physical designs or tests in wind tunnels.\n\n\"That's a really complicated difficulty because you possess shock waves found in engines which are incredibly thin scales when compared to amount of the combustion,\" Nichols said. \"And then you have combustion as well as turbulence in everything. The theory is that people can predict the behaviour. If given enough resolution we can predict what will happen with various kinds of designs.\"\n\nThe analysis of scram jets and the conditions under which they might fail involves similar complexity. \"NASA is very much enthusiastic about such vehicles for access to space,\" Moin stated. \"These will be air-breathing vehicles instead of rockets. They take their personal oxygen to orbit; they're heavier due to that. They have to carry liquid oxygen.\"\n\nFor now, the researchers must continue this work with paltry sub-million-main supercomputers. But most likely it won't be a long time before supercomputers as powerful as Sequoia will be the standard for such research.\n\nAs a high school student in 1994, Nichols attended a summer season course at Lawrence Livermore and done the Cray Y-MP. At that time, it was among the faster machines on earth.\n\n\"Now Sequoia is 10 million times stronger than that equipment,\" Nichols said. \"This is presenting us a glimpse into the future, that it is really possible to run on a million cores.\"","slug":"16-petaflops-and-more-core-without-it-blowing-up","published":1,"updated":"2019-02-22T11:59:28.110Z","_id":"cjsekxrqd000flgugipkz4gid","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p><img src=\"/images/4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"With-16-petaflops-and-1-6M-cores-DOE-supercomputer-is-world’s-fastest\"><a href=\"#With-16-petaflops-and-1-6M-cores-DOE-supercomputer-is-world’s-fastest\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"With 16 petaflops and 1.6M cores, DOE supercomputer is world’s fastest\"></a>With 16 petaflops and 1.6M cores, DOE supercomputer is world’s fastest</h2><p>Every six months, Earth’s most important supercomputers have a huge race to see that may lay claim to getting the world’s most effective high-performance computing cluster.</p>\n<p>In the most recent Top 500 Supercomputer Sites list unveiled Monday morning hours, a newly assembled cluster constructed with IBM hardware at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) takes the most notable prize.

It’s an optical network that delivers 40 Gbps throughput to IBM’s Blue Gene/Q clusters. I/O nodes are linked to the file program via Infiniband and the administration network uses Ethernet, Cupps stated.</p>\n<p>IBM leads the most notable 500 list with 213 systems, before HP’s 138. Practically 80 percent-372 of the 500 systems-use Intel processors, accompanied by 63 employing AMD Operton and 58 using IBM Power.</p>\n<p>Three DOE systems happen to be in the very best 10. The others hail from Japan, Germany, China, Italy, and France. All 10 have effectiveness of at least at least 1.27 petaflops.</p>\n<p>Petascale computers have become relatively commonplace because the IBM Roadrunner program in Los Alamos National Laboratory was first the first to hit a petaflop in 2008. Actually, each of the top 20 devices on the brand new list hit at least a petaflop. Exascale, which would be 1,000 times faster, is the next big breakthrough for the IBMs, HPs, and Crays of the universe to aspire to.</p>\n<p>But a big progress in price-performance is necessary. Today’s technology could level up a lot higher-it merely wouldn’t be practical. Supercomputers are naturally pricey (a lot more expensive than the latest MacBook Pro). The K Computer in Japan, for instance, cost a lot more than $1 billion to build and $10 million to operate each year. Livermore informed us it spent approximately $250 million on Sequoia.</p>\n<p>We’re able to get another order of magnitude with this technology if somebody would compose a check, Turek stated. But no one would want to write that check.�</p>\n<h3 id=\"How-to-use-a-good-million-core-supercomputer-without-it-blowing-up-in-that-person\"><a href=\"#How-to-use-a-good-million-core-supercomputer-without-it-blowing-up-in-that-person\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How to use a good million-core supercomputer-without it blowing up in that person\"></a>How to use a good million-core supercomputer-without it blowing up in that person</h3><p><em>Throwing more cores by science: risky for high reward.</em></p>\n<p>At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, a supercomputer named “Sequoia” puts almost every other computer on earth to shame. With 1.6 million processor cores (16 per CPU) across 96 racks, Sequoia can perform 16 thousand trillion calculations per second, or 16.32 petaflops.</p>\n<p>Who would demand such horsepower? The IBM Blue Gene/Q-based program was designed for the Section of Strength for simulations designed to lengthen the lifespan of nuclear weapons. But also for a limited time, the device is being distributed around outside researchers to execute a variety of tests, a couple of hours at a time.</p>\n<p>One of the first to have good thing about this opportunity was Stanford University’s Center for Turbulence Research-and it wasn’t hesitant about seeing what this equipment is really capable of. For three hours on Tuesday of last week, researchers from the center remotely logged in to Sequoia to perform a computational liquid dynamics (CFD) simulation on a million cores at once-1,048,576 cores, to be exact.</p>\n<p>It’s part of a good project to test noise made by supersonic jet engines and support design engines that happen to be a bit quieter. The work is sponsored partly by the united states Navy, which is concerned about “hearing damage that sailors on aircraft carrier decks come across as a result of jet noise,” Study Associate Joseph Nichols of the guts for Turbulence Exploration told Ars.</p>\n<p>Using huge supercomputers to solve complex scientific problems is usually in no way unique nowadays. Larger amounts of cores don’t necessarily translate to the most effective speed, either, as a result of dissimilarities between processors and the styles of supercomputers. The million-core run is normally intriguing, but it additionally poses extreme issues in trying to work with all those cores simultaneously without things going incorrect.</p>\n<p>Believe it or not, three several hours with a million cores wasn’t enough to generate a real dent in the plane noise project. Despite planning work aimed at reducing out bottlenecks, it was just enough time to make certain the code ran properly also to get yourself a sense of the possibilities that million-core PCs can offer.</p>\n<p>“This is really showing what we are able to do later on,” Nichols said. “The simulations take some time to boot up and go through initialization. We performed tune the I/O for the Blue Gene architecture, but it is nonetheless slower than the blindingly quickly computation and interaction speeds. Depending on how much info gets written, the I/O can truly add an extra chunk of period to the overhead.”</p>\n<p>The problems are all over the area, including “How can you write into one file from a million processors that are trying to step on one another?” Nichols said. “That was an interesting thing. It kind of depended on the interconnect, too. Only a number of the processors happen to be linked to the disk, and that means you need to rearrange data to achieve the right performance.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"Extra-cores-or-better-cores\"><a href=\"#Extra-cores-or-better-cores\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Extra cores, or better cores?\"></a>Extra cores, or better cores?</h2><p>Sequoia was named the world’s quickest supercomputer in June 2012. Sequoia soon after fell to second place behind a 17.59-petaflop system at the Oak Ridge Countrywide Laboratory, but it is still the only system at the top 500 supercomputers list with a million or even more cores.</p>\n<p>Of course, choosing “more cores” isn’t necessarily the easiest method to tackle a supercomputing problem. That Oak Ridge pc, named Titan, hit 17.59 petaflops using “only” 560,640 cores. The Titan program was developed by the supercomputer producer Cray, and it uses Nvidia design processing units furthermore to classic CPUs to get dramatic increases in quickness.</p>\n<p>There are pros and cons to different approaches. Dave Turek, IBM vice president of powerful computing, told Ars this past year that GPUs happen to be more difficult to program for, and the GPU-significantly less Sequoia is for “real science.” Titan, it should be noted, does plenty of real technology, tackling problems linked to climate transformation, astrophysics, and more. With both CPUs and GPUs in something, Titan’s CPUs guide the simulations but hand off do the job to the GPUs, which can handle a lot more calculations at once despite using only slightly more electricity.</p>\n<p>Throwing more cores at a problem doesn’t invariably result in performance gains. Code needs to be carefully well prepared to take into account the bottlenecks that come up when information is transmitted from one core to another (unless the request is so parallel that each core could work on split calculations without ever talking to each other).</p>\n<p>Previously, Nichols’ biggest calculation was performed for approximately 100 hours on 131,072 cores on a Blue Gene/P system. The same calculation could possibly be done on a million Sequoia cores in about 8 to 12 time, he said.</p>\n<p>Besides accelerating lengthy calculations, even more cores and faster supercomputers will let scientists tackle a lot more complicated problems.</p>\n<p>“Having more cores, either you reduce the time to choice or you solve more technical problems, problems involving circulation that involve, say, chemical substance reactions, combustion,” stated Parviz Moin, director of the guts for Turbulence Research. “These are grand challenge problems that involve many, many more equations and lots of work that will be distributed among the processors.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"Getting-code-geared-up-for-the-million-core-run\"><a href=\"#Getting-code-geared-up-for-the-million-core-run\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Getting code geared up for the million-core run\"></a>Getting code geared up for the million-core run</h2><p>Nichols and team use the Navier-Stokes equations and codenamed CharLES for the plane noise simulations (LES means large eddy simulation). They’re employing the same code for different projects to research scram jets (supersonic combustion ramjets), which could travel at 10 situations the speed of audio.</p>\n<p>We’ve written before about large supercomputing runs-for example, one using 50,000 cores on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. That one was “embarrassingly parallel,” where the calculations are all independent of each other. Which means the swiftness of the interconnect, the connections between each processing key, didn’t really matter.</p>\n<p>The million-core run was not only substantially bigger, it was more complicated. “It is parallel but there is connection [between processors] included,” Moin explained. “Each core is not independent.”</p>\n<p>As we wrote in August 2011, Blue Gene/Q uses “transactional memory space” to solve many of the issues that help to make highly scalable parallel development so hard. But prep function by humans is still required.</p>\n<p>Nichols caused the Lawrence Livermore individuals to optimize the code for Sequoia, avoiding slowdowns found in I/O efficiency and minimizing the communication needed in each step.</p>\n<p>Sequoia uses IBM’s proprietary 5-dimensional Torus interconnect. Nichols explains:</p>\n<p>“Each compute node is linked to 10 of its nearest neighbours. There will be five measurements and it goes forwards and backward along each dimension. That’s 5x2 and you get 10 connections with these optical links.”</p>\n<p>“You can communicate with processors that are even more away, but it includes a bigger latency. Latency for the nearest neighbour is normally 80 nanoseconds, which is very amazing. The calculation uses the interconnect so that communication overhead was very little actually at a million processors.”</p>\n<p>Performance scaled almost in a one-to-1 ratio with the increase in cores, with 83 percent efficiency. Nichols clarifies that since heading from 131,000 cores to at least one 1 million multiplies the amount of cores by 8, one would want a speed-up of 8 as well.</p>\n<p>The true speed-up was 6.6, which is “83 percent of the perfect speed-up we would like to see. It signifies that as we’re adding considerably more cores the code gets faster and faster, also at the million level. This is amazing for a CFD simulation, because in CFD simulations each one of these sub-domains features to talk to its neighbours at each time step to talk about wave information.”</p>\n<p>Modelling plane engines is sophisticated, as Stanford notes in a description of the project: “These complex simulations let researchers to peer inside and measure processes happening within the tough exhaust environment that’s otherwise inaccessible to experimental devices.”</p>\n<p>The simulations allow Stanford to test how adjustments to the engine nozzle and chevrons impact noise. With supercomputers these simulations can be carried out without building physical designs or tests in wind tunnels.</p>\n<p>“That’s a really complicated difficulty because you possess shock waves found in engines which are incredibly thin scales when compared to amount of the combustion,” Nichols said. “And then you have combustion as well as turbulence in everything. The theory is that people can predict the behaviour. If given enough resolution we can predict what will happen with various kinds of designs.”</p>\n<p>The analysis of scram jets and the conditions under which they might fail involves similar complexity. “NASA is very much enthusiastic about such vehicles for access to space,” Moin stated. “These will be air-breathing vehicles instead of rockets. They take their personal oxygen to orbit; they’re heavier due to that. They have to carry liquid oxygen.”</p>\n<p>For now, the researchers must continue this work with paltry sub-million-main supercomputers. But most likely it won’t be a long time before supercomputers as powerful as Sequoia will be the standard for such research.</p>\n<p>As a high school student in 1994, Nichols attended a summer season course at Lawrence Livermore and done the Cray Y-MP. At that time, it was among the faster machines on earth.</p>\n<p>“Now Sequoia is 10 million times stronger than that equipment,” Nichols said. “This is presenting us a glimpse into the future, that it is really possible to run on a million cores.”</p>"},{"title":"Top Supercomputer","date":"2018-12-25T12:00:00.000Z","_content":"\n![](/images/5.jpg)\n\n## New GPU-Accelerated Supercomputers Transformation the total amount of Power on the TOP500\n\nFor the very first time in history, most of the flops added to the TOP500 list originated from GPUs rather than CPUs. Can be this the condition of things to come?\n\nIn the latest TOP500 ranks announced this week, 56 percent of the additional flops were due to NVIDIA Tesla GPUs working in new supercomputers - that based on the Nvidians, who love monitoring such things. In this instance, most of those extra flops originated from three top systems not used to the list: Summit, Sierra, and the AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure (ABCI). \n\nSummit, the new Best500 champ, pushed the prior number one system, the 93-petaflop Sunway TaihuLight, into second place with a Linpack score of 122.3 petaflops. Summit is powered by IBM servers, each one built with two Power9 CPUs and six V100 GPUs. Regarding to NVIDIA, 95 percent of the Summit's peak performance (187.7 petaflops) comes from the system's 27,686 GPUs.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nNVIDIA did an identical calculation for the less powerful, and somewhat less GPU-intense Sierra, which nowadays ranks as the 3rd fastest supercomputer on earth at 71.6 Linpack petaflops. And, although nearly the same as Summit, it features four V100 GPUs in each dual-socked Vitality9 node, rather than six. However, the 17,280 GPUs in Sierra still represent the lion's share of this system's flops.\n\nLikewise for the new ABCI machine found in Japan, which is currently that country's speediest supercomputer and is ranked fifth on the planet. Each of its servers pairs two Intel Xeon Gold CPUs with four V100 GPUs. Its 4,352 V100s deliver almost all the system's 19.9 Linpack petaflops.\n\nAs dramatic just as that 56 percent quantity is for latest TOP500 flops, the truth is probably even more impressive.  Relating to Ian Buck, vice president of NVIDIA's Accelerated Computing business unit, over fifty percent the Tesla GPUs they offer into the HPC/AI/info analytics space happen to be bought by buyers who hardly ever submit their devices for TOP500 consideration. Although many of these GPU-accelerated machines would qualify for an area on the list, these specific customers either don't value all the TOP500 fanfare or would prefer to certainly not advertise their hardware-buying behaviours to their competitors.\n\nIt's also value mentioning that the Tensor Cores found in the V100 GPUs, with their specialized 16-bit matrix maths capacity, endow these 3 new systems with more deep learning potential than any previous supercomputer. Summit by itself features over three peak exaflops of deep learning effectiveness. Sierra's functionality in this respect is more in a nearby of two peak exaflops, while the ABCI number is around half an exaflop. Taken along, these three supercomputers signify extra deep learning capability compared to the other 497 devices on the TOP500 list put together, at least from the perspective of theoretical performance.\n\nThe addition of AI/equipment learning/deep learning into the HPC application space is a comparatively new phenomenon, however the V100 appears to be acting as a catalyst. This year's TOP500 list represents a distinct shift towards devices that support both HPC and AI computing,� noted TOP500 writer Jack Dongarra, Professor at University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n\nWhile company's like Intel, Google, Fujitsu, Wave Processing, Graph core, and other folks are growing specialized deep learning accelerators for the data center, NVIDIA is sticking with a built-in AI-HPC design because of its Tesla GPU series. And this certainly seems to be paying down, given the growing pattern of using artificial intelligence to accelerate traditional HPC applications.  Although the percentage of users integrating HPC and AI continues to be relatively tiny, this mixed-work flow unit is slowly being extended to practically every technology and engineering domain, from conditions forecasting and economic analytics, to genomics and essential oil & gas exploration.\n\nBuck admits this interplay around traditional HPC modelling and machine learning continues to be in the initial stages, but maintains it's only likely to get extra intertwined.� He says despite the fact that some customers use only a subset of the Tesla GPU's features, the benefits of supporting 64-little bit HPC, equipment learning, and visualization on the same chip far outweighs any positive aspects that could be understood by single-goal accelerators.\n\nAnd, thanks in large portion to these deep-learning-enhanced V100 GPUs, mixed-workload equipment are actually popping up about a reasonably regular basis. For instance, although Summit was formerly going to be just another humongous supercomputer, it really is now staying groomed as a program for cutting-edge AI as well. In comparison, the ABCI system was conceived right from the start as an AI-in a position supercomputer that could serve users working both classic simulations and analytics, as well as deep learning workloads. Before this month, the MareNostrum supercomputer added three racks of Power9/V100 nodes, paving just how for critical deep learning job to commence at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. And even the addition of simply 12 V100 GPUs to the Nimbus cloud assistance at the Pawsey Supercomputing Center was enough to declare that AI would today be fair video game on the Aussie program.\n\nSeeing that Buck implied, you don't need to take benefit of the Tensor Cores to really get your money's well worth from the V100. At seven double-precision teraflops, the V100 is an extremely capable accelerator for regular supercomputing. And regarding to NVIDIA, there are 554 codes ported to these images chips, including all of the leading 15 HPC applications.\n\nBut as V100-powered systems get their way into exploration labs, universities, and professional datacenters, more researchers and engineers will end up being tempted to inject AI into their 64-bit applications. And whether this turns out to be a case of the tail wagging your dog or the various other way around, ultimately, it doesn't really subject. The HPC application landscape will be forever changed.\n\n## Distortions, Styles and Quirks in the June 2018 Leading500 List\n\n### Stuffing the list\n\nThe TOP500 list can be an intensely valuable tool for the HPC community, tracking aggregate trends over 25 years. Nevertheless, a few observers have noted that new publications of the Top rated500 list have many duplicate entries, often at anonymous sites.\n\nLet's park the debate on what is a legitimate HPC system or not for the present time and assume that any program that has completed a higher Performance Linpack (HPL) go is a good entry in the list.\n\nBut, there are 124 entries in the list that happen to be identical copies of different entries. Put simply, a single HPL run offers been done on one system, and the vendor has said \"Since we've marketed N copies of that machine, we can send N entries on the list\".\n\nWhat goes on to the list figures if we delete all of the duplicate systems?\n\nThe set of 500 reduces to 376 entries.\n\nThe largest change is Lenovo, dropping from 117 entries to just sixty-one - yes, there are 56 duplicate entries from Lenovo! HPE drops from 79 to 62 entries and retakes the most notable spot for greatest show of the list with 16.5 percent. Lenovo drops to second place with 16.2 percent share.\n\nDoes this matter? Very well, it probably will to Lenovo, who thought we would submit many copies, and HPE, who probably sold various copies but chose not to send the duplicates. And eventually it matters with their market share PR.\n\nFor ordinary people, it comes down to what the list is about. If it likely to list the 500 quickest supercomputers on the globe, clearly it doesn't do this as many supercomputer owners choose not to acknowledge their devices. Is it the set of regarded supercomputers? No, because several referred to supercomputers are not listed, for instance, Blue Waters. Hence, it can only be a set of acknowledged HPL works, which would recommend that the copies approach is wrong.\n\nHowever, it isn't simply because simple mainly because that. If the list is normally for monitoring vendor/technology market share, then list stuffing is okay - even desired. If the list is usually for monitoring adoption of technology, vendor wins, the fortunes of HPC sites, and improvement of nations, in that case If argue that stuffing in this manner breaks the usefulness of the list.\n\nThe comparison of progress of nations can be affected. Carry out we measure just how many devices deployed? Or who gets the biggest system? I think the list stuffing is certainly less critical below, as we are able to readily extract both developments.\n\nI'm not sure there is a right or wrong answer to this but, as often, the headline statistics of market share just tell one aspect of the story, and users of the list must dig deeper for appropriate insight.\n\n### Anonymity rules\n\nAnother value of the list over time has been the capability to track who is ordering supercomputers and what they are employing them for.\n\nIn the June 2018 list, 97 percent of the systems do not specify an application area. This implies this categorization is actually meaningless. Either drop it from upcoming lists or require long term systems to identify an application area.\n\nBut, beyond that, the June 2018 List features 283 (!) anonymous entries. That's over one half of the list where we have no idea the business or site that has deployed the system nor, in most cases, what it really is being used for.\n\nThe big question is: does that render meaningless the opportunity to track the who and what of HPC, or would we be in a worse position if we excluded anonymous systems?\n\nThere are maybe 238 systems which can be lumped into cloud / IT service / web hosting companies, and it is the sheer quantity of these that delivers the possibly unhelpful distortion.\n\nThe rest of the 45 arguably represent real HPC deployments and have plenty of categorization (e.g., \"Strength Company\" to be useful. Useful guesses can even be produced for some of these anonymous systems. For example, one might reckon that \"Energy Firm (A)\" found in Italy is in fact Eni. The 45 devices are a mixture of energy, manufacturing, authorities, or finance sectors. Many interestingly, a few university devices are listed anonymously also!\n\n### Supercomputers in Industry\n\nOf the 284 devices listed as Industry, only 16 systems actually have named owners that aren't cloud suppliers (the other 268 are usually the anonymous companies and Stuffing discussed above). In fact, due to multiple systems per web page, we actually only employ a few listed companies. These are Eni, Total, PGS, Saudi Aramco, BASF, EDF, Volvo and the suppliers Intel, NVIDIA, and PEZY.\n\nI just assure you there are a lot more supercomputers out there in industry than this. I intend to explore the Major500 tendencies, along lessons from my impartial HPC consulting job, of HPC systems in industry for a future article. Look out for this after ISC18.\n\n### Hope\n\nI've previously said that the HPC is lucky to really have the TOP500 list. It is a info set collected in a regular manner twice annually for 25 years, with each entry recording many characteristics - vendor, technology details, effectiveness, location, year of entry, etc. That is a hugely wealthy resource for our network, and the TOP500 authors did an amazing task over 25 years to keep carefully the list valuable as the world of HPC has evolved enormously. I have high confidence in the authors efficiently addressing the challenges right here and keeping the list as a great resource for years to come.","source":"_posts/top-supercomputer.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Top Supercomputer\ndate: 2018-12-25 20:00:00\ncategory: recommended of the year\n---\n\n![](/images/5.jpg)\n\n## New GPU-Accelerated Supercomputers Transformation the total amount of Power on the TOP500\n\nFor the very first time in history, most of the flops added to the TOP500 list originated from GPUs rather than CPUs.

Relating to Ian Buck, vice president of NVIDIA’s Accelerated Computing business unit, over fifty percent the Tesla GPUs they offer into the HPC/AI/info analytics space happen to be bought by buyers who hardly ever submit their devices for TOP500 consideration. Although many of these GPU-accelerated machines would qualify for an area on the list, these specific customers either don’t value all the TOP500 fanfare or would prefer to certainly not advertise their hardware-buying behaviours to their competitors.</p>\n<p>It’s also value mentioning that the Tensor Cores found in the V100 GPUs, with their specialized 16-bit matrix maths capacity, endow these 3 new systems with more deep learning potential than any previous supercomputer. Summit by itself features over three peak exaflops of deep learning effectiveness. Sierra’s functionality in this respect is more in a nearby of two peak exaflops, while the ABCI number is around half an exaflop. Taken along, these three supercomputers signify extra deep learning capability compared to the other 497 devices on the TOP500 list put together, at least from the perspective of theoretical performance.</p>\n<p>The addition of AI/equipment learning/deep learning into the HPC application space is a comparatively new phenomenon, however the V100 appears to be acting as a catalyst. This year’s TOP500 list represents a distinct shift towards devices that support both HPC and AI computing,� noted TOP500 writer Jack Dongarra, Professor at University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</p>\n<p>While company’s like Intel, Google, Fujitsu, Wave Processing, Graph core, and other folks are growing specialized deep learning accelerators for the data center, NVIDIA is sticking with a built-in AI-HPC design because of its Tesla GPU series. And this certainly seems to be paying down, given the growing pattern of using artificial intelligence to accelerate traditional HPC applications.  Although the percentage of users integrating HPC and AI continues to be relatively tiny, this mixed-work flow unit is slowly being extended to practically every technology and engineering domain, from conditions forecasting and economic analytics, to genomics and essential oil &amp; gas exploration.</p>\n<p>Buck admits this interplay around traditional HPC modelling and machine learning continues to be in the initial stages, but maintains it’s only likely to get extra intertwined.� He says despite the fact that some customers use only a subset of the Tesla GPU’s features, the benefits of supporting 64-little bit HPC, equipment learning, and visualization on the same chip far outweighs any positive aspects that could be understood by single-goal accelerators.</p>\n<p>And, thanks in large portion to these deep-learning-enhanced V100 GPUs, mixed-workload equipment are actually popping up about a reasonably regular basis. For instance, although Summit was formerly going to be just another humongous supercomputer, it really is now staying groomed as a program for cutting-edge AI as well. In comparison, the ABCI system was conceived right from the start as an AI-in a position supercomputer that could serve users working both classic simulations and analytics, as well as deep learning workloads. Before this month, the MareNostrum supercomputer added three racks of Power9/V100 nodes, paving just how for critical deep learning job to commence at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center.

At seven double-precision teraflops, the V100 is an extremely capable accelerator for regular supercomputing. And regarding to NVIDIA, there are 554 codes ported to these images chips, including all of the leading 15 HPC applications.</p>\n<p>But as V100-powered systems get their way into exploration labs, universities, and professional datacenters, more researchers and engineers will end up being tempted to inject AI into their 64-bit applications.

While at the university, Meuer was co-founder and organizer of the first of all Mannheim Supercomputer Seminar in 1986, an gross annual appointment referred to today as the International Supercomputing Meeting (ISC).Meuer features served as the Meeting General Chair since the very beginning. Since 1998, he has been managing director of Prometeus GmbH.\n\nThe TOP500 list was created as a project for the June 1993 meeting in Mannheim, and updated for the Supercomputing 93 conference held that November. The list continues to be released at ISC every June and SC in November.\n\nAhead of joining the University of Mannheim, Meuer served as specialist, task leader, group and department chief during his 11 years at the study Center in Julich,Germany, from 1962 - 73. Furthermore to his afore stated activities, Hans Meuer offers been editor-in-chief of the professional IT journal PIK - Praxis der Informationsverarbeitung und Kommunikation(published by KG Saur VerlagMunchen, Munich), from 1986 - 2004. He was a member of the professional societies ACM and GI. He posted numerous articles in the areas of mathematics, data processing and computer research.\n\nMeuer studied mathematics, physics and politics in the universities of Marburg, Giessen and Vienna. He graduated at the University of Giessen in 1962and in 1972, he received his doctorate in used mathematics from the Rheinisch Westfalischen Complex University (RWTH) of Aachen. \n\nProf. Dr. Hans Werner Meuer passed on at the age of 77 at his residence in Daisbach, Southern Germany, on January 20, 2014, after a short battle with cancer.\n\n### ERICH STROHMAIER'\n\nDealing with Prof. Hans Meuer, Erich Strohmaier created the primary Major500 list in June 1993. On his primary day at the brand new task at the University of Mannheim, he attended a tiny university conference, the \"Mannheimer Supercomputer Seminar\" organized by Meuer and Dr. Hans-Martin Wacker. One of is own duties while working for Prof. Meuer was to put together statistics on all over the world supercomputers in planning for the annual assembly of the meeting. Thinking it could be a one-time deal, Strohmaier created a data source on his pc for just that. But then Meuer and Strohmaier made a decision to see how much the list would switch in five a few months and recalculated the list in time to provide the effects at the 1993 Supercomputing meeting placed in November in Portland, Oregon. The Leading500 list of the world's leading supercomputers was born.\n\nStrohmaier earned his Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1990. Since his thesis centered on numerical strategies in elementary particle physics that he used the largest supercomputers obtainable, he accepted a study position in HPC at the University of Mannheim for a fresh project comparing the effectiveness of a number of physics applications on a Fujitsu VP2600 supercomputer. In 1995, as that exploration funding was closing, he decided to choose a position in the U.S. and ended up dealing with Linpack writer and fellow TOP500 editor Jack Dongarra, at the University of Tennessee. He relocated to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2001. Furthermore to his current role as head into the future Technology Group at Berkeley Lab, he is also the principal investigator of the Department of Energy-funded CACHE Institute, a joint mathematics and computer system science institute centered on Interaction Avoiding and Interaction Hiding at Intensive Scales. In 2008, he was an associate of the staff which received the ACM Gordon Bell Prize for Algorithm Development.\n\n### JACK DONGARRA\n\nJack Dongarra has been involved because the origin and formation of the Major500 list in 1993, that used his Linpack benchmark seeing that the common request for evaluating the overall performance of supercomputers. Through the constant usage of the Linpack benchmark, the Major500 list offers a standardized measure of supercomputers over the past 25 years. Dongarra retains appointments at the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He's a Faculty Fellow at Texas A&M University's Institute for Advanced Analysis and Turing Fellow at the University of Manchester. He's also an Adjunct Professor at Rice University. He specializes in numerical algorithms in linear algebra, parallel computing, use of advanced-computer system architectures, programming methodology, and tools for parallel personal computers. \n\nFurthermore to Linpack and the TOP500, Dongarra has contributed to the look and implementation of the following open source software packages and devices: EISPACK, the BLAS, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK, Net-lib, PVM, MPI, Open-MPI, NetSolve, ATLAS, PAPI, PLASMA, and MAGMA. He has published approximately 200 articles, papers, studies and specialized memoranda and he's co-author of several literature. He was awarded the IEEE Sid Fernbach Award in 2004 for his contributions in the use of powerful computers using innovative techniques; in 2008 he was the recipient of the primary IEEE Medal of Excellence in Scalable Computing; in 2010 2010 he was the earliest recipient of the SIAM Particular Fascination Group on Supercomputer's award for Job Achievement; and in 2011 he was the recipient of the IEEE IPDPS 2011 Charles Babbage Award. He is a Fellow of the AAAS, ACM, IEEE, and SIAM and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. Dongarra provides been an ISC Fellow since 2012.\n\nDongarra received a Bachelor of Science found in Mathematics from Chicago Condition University found in 1972 and a Expert of Science in Pc Technology from the Illinois Institute of Technology found in 1973. He received his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of New Mexico in 1980. He worked at the Argonne National Laboratory until 1989, learning to be a senior scientist. He's the director of the Impressive Processing Laboratory at the University of Tennessee.","source":"_posts/the-linpack-benchmark.md","raw":"---\ntitle: The Linpack Benchmark\ndate: 2018-2-01 11:00:00\ncategory: news\n---\n\n![](/images/7.jpg)\n\nAs a yardstick of efficiency we are employing the `best' effectiveness as measured by the LINPACK Benchmark.

The list continues to be released at ISC every June and SC in November.</p>\n<p>Ahead of joining the University of Mannheim, Meuer served as specialist, task leader, group and department chief during his 11 years at the study Center in Julich,Germany, from 1962 - 73. Furthermore to his afore stated activities, Hans Meuer offers been editor-in-chief of the professional IT journal PIK - Praxis der Informationsverarbeitung und Kommunikation(published by KG Saur VerlagMunchen, Munich), from 1986 - 2004. He was a member of the professional societies ACM and GI. He posted numerous articles in the areas of mathematics, data processing and computer research.</p>\n<p>Meuer studied mathematics, physics and politics in the universities of Marburg, Giessen and Vienna. He graduated at the University of Giessen in 1962and in 1972, he received his doctorate in used mathematics from the Rheinisch Westfalischen Complex University (RWTH) of Aachen. </p>\n<p>Prof. Dr. Hans Werner Meuer passed on at the age of 77 at his residence in Daisbach, Southern Germany, on January 20, 2014, after a short battle with cancer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ERICH-STROHMAIER’\"><a href=\"#ERICH-STROHMAIER’\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"ERICH STROHMAIER’\"></a>ERICH STROHMAIER’</h3><p>Dealing with Prof. Hans Meuer, Erich Strohmaier created the primary Major500 list in June 1993. On his primary day at the brand new task at the University of Mannheim, he attended a tiny university conference, the “Mannheimer Supercomputer Seminar” organized by Meuer and Dr. Hans-Martin Wacker. One of is own duties while working for Prof. Meuer was to put together statistics on all over the world supercomputers in planning for the annual assembly of the meeting. Thinking it could be a one-time deal, Strohmaier created a data source on his pc for just that. But then Meuer and Strohmaier made a decision to see how much the list would switch in five a few months and recalculated the list in time to provide the effects at the 1993 Supercomputing meeting placed in November in Portland, Oregon. The Leading500 list of the world’s leading supercomputers was born.</p>\n<p>Strohmaier earned his Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1990. Since his thesis centered on numerical strategies in elementary particle physics that he used the largest supercomputers obtainable, he accepted a study position in HPC at the University of Mannheim for a fresh project comparing the effectiveness of a number of physics applications on a Fujitsu VP2600 supercomputer. In 1995, as that exploration funding was closing, he decided to choose a position in the U.S. and ended up dealing with Linpack writer and fellow TOP500 editor Jack Dongarra, at the University of Tennessee. He relocated to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2001. Furthermore to his current role as head into the future Technology Group at Berkeley Lab, he is also the principal investigator of the Department of Energy-funded CACHE Institute, a joint mathematics and computer system science institute centered on Interaction Avoiding and Interaction Hiding at Intensive Scales. In 2008, he was an associate of the staff which received the ACM Gordon Bell Prize for Algorithm Development.</p>\n<h3 id=\"JACK-DONGARRA\"><a href=\"#JACK-DONGARRA\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"JACK DONGARRA\"></a>JACK DONGARRA</h3><p>Jack Dongarra has been involved because the origin and formation of the Major500 list in 1993, that used his Linpack benchmark seeing that the common request for evaluating the overall performance of supercomputers. Through the constant usage of the Linpack benchmark, the Major500 list offers a standardized measure of supercomputers over the past 25 years. Dongarra retains appointments at the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He’s a Faculty Fellow at Texas A&amp;M University’s Institute for Advanced Analysis and Turing Fellow at the University of Manchester. He’s also an Adjunct Professor at Rice University. He specializes in numerical algorithms in linear algebra, parallel computing, use of advanced-computer system architectures, programming methodology, and tools for parallel personal computers. </p>\n<p>Furthermore to Linpack and the TOP500, Dongarra has contributed to the look and implementation of the following open source software packages and devices: EISPACK, the BLAS, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK, Net-lib, PVM, MPI, Open-MPI, NetSolve, ATLAS, PAPI, PLASMA, and MAGMA. He has published approximately 200 articles, papers, studies and specialized memoranda and he’s co-author of several literature. He was awarded the IEEE Sid Fernbach Award in 2004 for his contributions in the use of powerful computers using innovative techniques; in 2008 he was the recipient of the primary IEEE Medal of Excellence in Scalable Computing; in 2010 2010 he was the earliest recipient of the SIAM Particular Fascination Group on Supercomputer’s award for Job Achievement; and in 2011 he was the recipient of the IEEE IPDPS 2011 Charles Babbage Award. He is a Fellow of the AAAS, ACM, IEEE, and SIAM and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. Dongarra provides been an ISC Fellow since 2012.</p>\n<p>Dongarra received a Bachelor of Science found in Mathematics from Chicago Condition University found in 1972 and a Expert of Science in Pc Technology from the Illinois Institute of Technology found in 1973. He received his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of New Mexico in 1980. He worked at the Argonne National Laboratory until 1989, learning to be a senior scientist.

In a few circumstances we interpolated between two measured program sizes or we scaled by cycle times. For products where we did not receive the requested data, the performance of another smaller system measured can be used.</p>","more":"<p>If there must be any improvements in the performances given in the next desk we will update them.</p>\n<p>In addition to cross checking several resources of information, we select randomly a statistical representative sample of the first 500 devices of our database.

That is done for each and every vendor individually by limiting the accumulated effectiveness of systems at vendor sites to a maximum of 5% of the total accumulated installed effectiveness of the vendor. Rounding is performed in favour of the vendor in question.</p>\n<p>In the TOP500 List table, the computers are ordered initially by their Rmax value. In the case of equal performances (Rmax benefit) for different computers, we’ve chosen to buy by Rpeak.

Twice a yr, a list of the sites operating the 500 most effective computer systems is assembled and introduced. The best efficiency on the Linpack benchmark is utilized as efficiency measure for ranking the personal computers. The list consists of a range of information like the system specs and its major application areas.</p>\n<p>Each year the 1st TOP500 list is released through the ISC High Performance Meeting.

Please article any Linpack performance quantities directly to him.</p>\n<p><em>Method of Solution</em><br>In an attempt to get hold of uniformity across all computers in performance reporting, the algorithm used in solving the system of equations in the benchmark process must confirm to LU factorization with partial pivoting. Specifically, the operation count for the algorithm should be 2/3 n^3 + O(n^2) double stage floating point operations. This excludes the consumption of a fast matrix multiply algorithm like ``Strassen’s Method’’ or algorithms which compute a remedy in a precision lower than full precision (64 bit floating level arithmetic) and refine the perfect solution is using an iterative strategy. This is done to supply a comparable set of performance quantities across all PCs.</p>\n<p><em>Verification</em><br>Furthermore to cross checking several sources of information, we select randomly a statistical representative sample of the 1st 500 devices of our data source. For these systems we ask the distributor of the information to establish direct contact between the installation blog and us to verify the offered information. Thus giving us basic information about the quality of the list altogether.</p>\n<p><em>Restrictions</em><br>As the TOP500 should provide a basis for figures available of high-performance computer systems, we limit the quantity of systems installed at vendor sites. This is done for every single vendor individually by limiting the accumulated efficiency of devices at vendor sites to no more than 5% of the total accumulated installed efficiency of the vendor. Rounding is performed in favor of owner in question.</p>\n<p>The main objective of the TOP500 list is to supply a ranked list of general purpose systems that are in common use for top quality applications. The authors of the Leading500 reserve the right to individually verify submitted Linpack effects, and exclude systems from the list that are not valid or not general goal in nature. By general purpose system we imply that the computer system must be in a position to be used to fix a range of scientific challenges. Any system designed especially to fix the Linpack benchmark trouble or possess as its important purpose the purpose of a high Top rated500 ranking will get disqualified.</p>\n<p>The devices in the TOP500 list are anticipated to come to be persistent and available for use for a protracted period of time. Any program assembled to run a Linpack benchmark simply, and create specifically to get an access in the TOP500 will come to be excluded from the list.
