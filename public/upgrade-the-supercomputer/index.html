<p>The TOP500 table shows the 500 most powerful commercially available computer systems known to us. To keep the list as compact as feasible, we show only part of our information here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Nworld - Location within the TOP500 ranking</p>
</li>
<li><p>Manufacturer - Manufacturer or vendor</p>
</li>
<li><p>Computer system - Type indicated by maker or vendor</p>
</li>
<li><p>Installation Site - Customer</p>
</li>
<li><p>Location - Location and country</p>
</li>
<li><p>Year - Year of assembly/last major update</p>
</li>
<li><p>Field of Application</p>
</li>
<li><p>#Proc. - Quantity of processors (Cores)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rmax - Maximal LINPACK performance achieved</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rpeak - Theoretical peak performance</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nmax - Issue size for achieving Rmax</p>
</li>
<li><p>N1/2 - Problem size for attaining half of Rmax</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If Rmax from Desk 3 of the LINPACK Report is not available, we use the TPP performance provided in Table 1 of the LINPACK Report for solving something of 1000 equations. In a few circumstances we interpolated between two measured program sizes or we scaled by cycle times. For products where we did not receive the requested data, the performance of another smaller system measured can be used.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>If there must be any improvements in the performances given in the next desk we will update them.</p>
<p>In addition to cross checking several resources of information, we select randomly a statistical representative sample of the first 500 devices of our database. For these devices we ask the provider of the information to establish direct contact between your installation blog and us to verify the granted information. Thus giving us basic info on the quality of the list in total.</p>
<p>As the TOP500 should give a basis for figures that you can buy of high-performance PCs, we limit the quantity of devices installed at vendor sites. That is done for each and every vendor individually by limiting the accumulated effectiveness of systems at vendor sites to a maximum of 5% of the total accumulated installed effectiveness of the vendor. Rounding is performed in favour of the vendor in question.</p>
<p>In the TOP500 List table, the computers are ordered initially by their Rmax value. In the case of equal performances (Rmax benefit) for different computers, we’ve chosen to buy by Rpeak. For sites that contain the same pc, the purchase is by recollection size and alphabetically.</p>
<h2 id="DEMAND-PARTICIPATION-IN-THE-Top-rated500-GREEN500-LISTS"><a href="#DEMAND-PARTICIPATION-IN-THE-Top-rated500-GREEN500-LISTS" class="headerlink" title="DEMAND PARTICIPATION IN THE Top rated500 / GREEN500 LISTS"></a>DEMAND PARTICIPATION IN THE Top rated500 / GREEN500 LISTS</h2><p>The TOP500 project was started in 1993 to provide a reliable basis for tracking and detecting trends in high-performance computing. Twice a yr, a list of the sites operating the 500 most effective computer systems is assembled and introduced. The best efficiency on the Linpack benchmark is utilized as efficiency measure for ranking the personal computers. The list consists of a range of information like the system specs and its major application areas.</p>
<p>Each year the 1st TOP500 list is released through the ISC High Performance Meeting. In 2018, the conference will be held in Frankfurt, Germany (June 24 - 28) and the SC conference in America, this year placed in Dallas (November 11th-16th, 2018)</p>
<p>The List’s maintainers are enthusiastic about new entries and entries that are no more valid. Please feel absolve to contact them in this article should you have questions.</p>
<h3 id="Following-is-a-transcript-of-the-guidelines-for-submission-of-entries"><a href="#Following-is-a-transcript-of-the-guidelines-for-submission-of-entries" class="headerlink" title="Following is a transcript of the guidelines for submission of entries:"></a>Following is a transcript of the guidelines for submission of entries:</h3><p><em>Deadlines</em><br>The deadline for the submission of new sites for the November release of the TOP500 List is October 25th (23:59 PST). All system reported need to be set up by November 1st. The last time for submitting Linpack updates can be November 1st ( Systems will need to have been submitted by the deadline above).</p>
<p>Submission deadline for the June release of the TOP500 List is June 1st (23:59 PST). All system reported must be installed by June 8th. The last date for submitting Linpack improvements can be June 8th. (Devices will need to have been submitted by June 1st)</p>
<p><em>Submissions</em><br>The submission site is now open. You may want to make a new account in order to submit systems.</p>
<p>Please note that this is a totally new interface and you possess to produce a new login and password.</p>
<p>Submissions should support the following information:</p>
<p>Manufacturer: Manufacturer or vendor</p>
<p>Computer program: Type indicated by company or vendor</p>
<p>Installation Site: Customer - Name of company or institution</p>
<p>Location: Location and country</p>
<p>Year: Year of assembly/last major update</p>
<p>Field of Application: Kind of customer (university, federal government, industry, …) in addition to typical application (geophysics, motor vehicle, chemical, benchmarking, …)</p>
<p>Processors: Quantity of processors (and also type if necessary)</p>
<p>Memory: Main memory construction of the system</p>
<p>By submitting the application to be contained in the List TOP500 published on www.top500.org you agree to the following conditions and conditions:</p>
<p>To the very best of your understanding, the info you provide to TOP500 and its own operator Prometeus GmbH is correct, complete and accurate.<br>You acknowledge and concur that your choice of TOP500 and its operator Prometeus GmbH to add or not include your brand in the list of TOP500 is entirely predicated on Prometeus� discretion rather than at the mercy of judicial review. This as well applies to the position the TOP500 and its operator Prometeus GmbH assigns to you on the set of TOP500.<br>The TOP500 and its own operator Prometeus GmbH may, with or without prior notice and with or without reason strike your name from the TOP500 List. This technique and decision is not at the mercy of judicial review.<br>EEHPC WG: Electric power Measurement Methodology<br>Click the link below to download the EEHPC WG Electric power Measurement Methodology to determine more about Level 2 and Level 3 measurements.</p>
<p><em>Linpack performance</em><br>Performance figures for the Linpack benchmark are collected and updated by Jack Dongarra (dongarra@cs.utk.edu). Please article any Linpack performance quantities directly to him.</p>
<p><em>Method of Solution</em><br>In an attempt to get hold of uniformity across all computers in performance reporting, the algorithm used in solving the system of equations in the benchmark process must confirm to LU factorization with partial pivoting. Specifically, the operation count for the algorithm should be 2/3 n^3 + O(n^2) double stage floating point operations. This excludes the consumption of a fast matrix multiply algorithm like ``Strassen’s Method’’ or algorithms which compute a remedy in a precision lower than full precision (64 bit floating level arithmetic) and refine the perfect solution is using an iterative strategy. This is done to supply a comparable set of performance quantities across all PCs.</p>
<p><em>Verification</em><br>Furthermore to cross checking several sources of information, we select randomly a statistical representative sample of the 1st 500 devices of our data source. For these systems we ask the distributor of the information to establish direct contact between the installation blog and us to verify the offered information. Thus giving us basic information about the quality of the list altogether.</p>
<p><em>Restrictions</em><br>As the TOP500 should provide a basis for figures available of high-performance computer systems, we limit the quantity of systems installed at vendor sites. This is done for every single vendor individually by limiting the accumulated efficiency of devices at vendor sites to no more than 5% of the total accumulated installed efficiency of the vendor. Rounding is performed in favor of owner in question.</p>
<p>The main objective of the TOP500 list is to supply a ranked list of general purpose systems that are in common use for top quality applications. The authors of the Leading500 reserve the right to individually verify submitted Linpack effects, and exclude systems from the list that are not valid or not general goal in nature. By general purpose system we imply that the computer system must be in a position to be used to fix a range of scientific challenges. Any system designed especially to fix the Linpack benchmark trouble or possess as its important purpose the purpose of a high Top rated500 ranking will get disqualified.</p>
<p>The devices in the TOP500 list are anticipated to come to be persistent and available for use for a protracted period of time. Any program assembled to run a Linpack benchmark simply, and create specifically to get an access in the TOP500 will come to be excluded from the list. The Major500 authors will reserve the right to deny inclusion in the list if it is suspected that the machine violates these conditions.</p>
